# KIC-Keep-It-Close-
IOT project - Android App.
Detecting lost items using Bluetooth Low Energy, by range signals strength (RSSI) and Microsoft Azure services and databases.
I used Adafruit Bluefruit BLE Arduino, Azure Tables and Android studio.
the project basically do 2 main things:-
1) send notification if I walked away 8 meters from my device (keys maybe) 
2) IF I forgot my device somehere, and someonelse intered the range of my lost BLE device he will send me notification automatically of the gps coordinates.
